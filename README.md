# TASK 3

- Using the language of your choice—from the Java/C#/PHP/JavaScript/TypeScript/Ruby/Python set, please—to write a script that implements a generalized rock-paper-scissors game (with the supports of arbitrary odd number of arbitrary combinations). Of course, it's recommended to use the language of your "specialization", but it's not required.

- When launched with command line parameters (arguments to the main or Main method in the case of Java or C#, sys.argv in Python, process.argv in Node.js, etc.) it accepts an odd number ≥ 3 non-repeating strings (if the arguments are incorrect, you must display a neat error message—what exactly is wrong and an example of how to do it right). All messages should be in English. These passed strings are moves (for example, Rock Paper Scissors or Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9).

- Important: moves are passed as command line arguments, you don't parse them from the input stream (for example, a move may contain a space, but it shouldn't matter to your code).

- The victory is defined as follows—half of the next moves in the circle wins, half of the previous moves in the circle lose (the semantics of the strings-moves is not important, he plays by the rules build upon the moves order the user used, even if the stone loses to scissors in its order—the contents of the strings-moves are not important for you).

- The script generates a cryptographically strong random key (SecureRandom, RandomNumberGenerator, etc. - mandatory) with a length of at least 256 bits, makes own (computer's) move, calculates HMAC (based on SHA2 or SHA3) from the own move as a message with the generated key, displays the HMAC to the user. After that the user gets "menu" 1 - Stone, 2 - Scissors, ...., 0 - Exit. The user makes his choice (in case of incorrect input, the "menu" is displayed again). The script shows who won, the move of the computer and the original key.

- Re-read the paragraph above, the sequence is critical (it simply doesn't make sense to do it differently, for example, showing the key before the user's turn or HMAC instead of the key).

- Thus the user can check that the computer plays fair (did not change its move after the user's move).

- When you select the "help" option in the terminal, you need to display a table (ASCII-graphic) that determines which move wins.

- The table generation should be in a separate class, the definition of the "rules" who won should be in a separate class, the key generation and HMAC functions should be in a separate class (at least 4 classes in total). You should use the core class libraries and third-party libraries to the maximum, and not reinvent the wheel. Help should be formatted as an N + 1 by N + 1 table, where N is the number of moves (determined by the number of arguments passed to the script). +1 to add a title for the rows and a title for the columns (contain the title of the move). Cells can contain Win/Lose/Draw.

- THE NUMBER OF MOVES CAN BE ARBITRARY (odd and > 1, depending on the passed parameters), it is not hardwired into the code.

```bash
>java -jar game.jar rock Spock paper lizard scissors
HMAC: 9ED68097B2D5D9A968E85BD7094C75D00F96680DC43CDD6918168A8F50DE8507
Available moves:
1 - rock
2 - Spock
3 - paper
4 - lizard
5 - scissors
0 - exit
? - help
Enter your move: 3
Your move: paper
Computer move: rock
You win!
HMAC key: BD9BE48334BB9C5EC263953DA54727F707E95544739FCE7359C267E734E380A2

```

- To submit the solution you need to send an e-mail to p.lebedev@itransition.com with the following:
  link to a video demonstrating launch with 3 and 7 parameters, launch with incorrect parameters (repeated or even number, one or no), help table generation (on 5 parameters), choice of the user move, output of results;
  link to Github public repository.

- Make the video publicly accessible. Don't try to share your video with my work e-mail or something. Make your video public.

- And as an explanation: when calculating HMAC, the key is the same secret key that you generated. And the message is a move string. After own move the user obtains a key and the computer's move& And the user will be able to calculate the HMAC and compare with the HMAC that was shown before the user's move. It's not very difficult

- A common mistake is trying to invent your "HMAC" as a hash of a random "key". This will not work. If you show the same lines before the move and after the move, the user does not receive new information after the move and, accordingly, you do not prove anything to him. It is necessary to generate a key (with a secure generator), make a computer move, calculate HMAC (by a standard algorithm) from a computer move (message) and a key (key), show HMAC, get a user move, show a key. Re-read this paragraph until the total comprehension.

- The example of the "correct" order (although the user may use a different order and play a game of scissors defeating rock; or play a game of MOVE1 MOVE2 MOVE3): STONE PAPER SCISSORS or STONE SPOCK PAPER LIZARD SCISSORS.

- What is this task for? You need to understand hash function a little bit deeper, understand why they are for, add HMAC idea, learn to think how the exact sequence of steps can give you some kind of prove or contract, work with external libraries, touch some basics of OOP and a few other things.

- DEADLINE for this and the rest of the tasks is the same—before the project start (you can check the schedule) -- 29.07.2024

## Table ex

- Sometimes words aren't enough, so here is an illustration for the TASK #3. For the moves A B C D E F G — who is losing to whom.
- How to improve usability of the console help table (make it more understandable).
  First of all, you may render header row with some emphasis. E.g. use some color.
  Second, you may replace "PC Moves" header with something more complex, like this:

```bash
+-------------+------+-------+----------+
| v PC\User > | Rock | Paper | Scissors |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+
| Rock        | Draw | Win   | Lose     |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+
| Paper       | Lose | Draw  | Win      |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+
| Scissors    | Win  | Lose  | Draw     |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+
```

And, the last, but not least, you may add some text before the table (e.g. state that the results are from user point of view and add, well, example).

Here is another example of the help table:

```bash
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+
| v PC\User > | Rock | Paper | 3rd move | 4th  | 5th  |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+
| Rock        | Draw | Win   | Win      | Lose | Lose |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+
| Paper       | Lose | Draw  | Win      | Win  | Lose |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+
| 3rd move    | Lose | Lose  | Draw     | Win  | Win  |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+
| 4th         | Win  | Lose  | Lose     | Draw | Win  |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+
| 5th         | Win  | Win   | Lose     | Lose | Draw |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+
```

And for 7:

```bash
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
| v PC\User > | Rock | Paper | 3rd move | 4th  | 5th  | 6th  | 7th  |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
| Rock        | Draw | Win   | Win      | Win  | Lose | Lose | Lose |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
| Paper       | Lose | Draw  | Win      | Win  | Win  | Lose | Lose |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
| 3rd move    | Lose | Lose  | Draw     | Win  | Win  | Win  | Lose |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
| 4th         | Lose | Lose  | Lose     | Draw | Win  | Win  | Win  |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
| 5th         | Win  | Lose  | Lose     | Lose | Draw | Win  | Win  |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
| 6th         | Win  | Win   | Lose     | Lose | Lose | Draw | Win  |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
| 7th         | Win  | Win   | Win      | Lose | Lose | Lose | Draw |
+-------------+------+-------+----------+------+------+------+------+
```

And so on (you need to support any odd move number). Of course, for large values it would be nice to implement some kind of pagination, but it's out of the scope of the basic task (you may consider it as an optional "for the highest grade" problem).

DON'T GENERATE TABLE "MANUALLY"—USE A THIRD-PARTY LIBRARY.

- And yet, a few more answers:

You have to use base class libraries and 3rd-party libraries for the implementation (esp. for console table generation).

You (I mean your code) generate a secret key first, then you generate a random move and then show only HMAC to the user. After that user makes their move. Then you show results, generated move as well as the secret key. And then user can check the fact that the computer move with the key give together exactly the same HMAC that was shown before.

You may generate a link at the end to some online service that allows HMAC calculation to simplify the "check" for the user, but it's not required.

Well, it's too early to help with the task #3, but here is some libraries you may use for your implementation of help tables: ascii-table (npm package) or ConsoleTable (Nuget package) or terminal-table (Ruby gem) or Console_Table (PHP). And so on.
